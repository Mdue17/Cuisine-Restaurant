Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

A fully responsive Restuarant app built with html and css.This project showcases my skills on the front-end app building

## Optimizations

* still need to add social media handles and svg's
* add some more testimonials from people
* add a menu page whereusers can see and order food(this will help me make it full-stack)

## Lessons Learned:

* i realised how useful it was to use conventional naming in HTML especcially when working on the CSS
